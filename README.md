Yes, I used AI as a mentor. No, this isn't 'slop'. If you can write a zero-I/O asynchronous stream reordering engine better than this — show me the code.
Otherwise, enjoy the tool.

# HydraStream

HydraStream is a concurrent HTTP downloader written in Python. It supports multipart downloading and in-memory chunk reordering, allowing you to stream remote files directly to `stdout` without writing to disk.

## Motivation

Standard tools like `wget` or `curl` stream sequentially but are limited to a single connection. Tools like `aria2` download concurrently but require disk I/O to reassemble the file.

This project bridges the gap: it fetches chunks concurrently via `httpx` and `uvloop`, buffers them in memory using a min-heap, and yields a sequential byte stream. This is useful for piping large remote files (e.g., genomics data, DB dumps) directly into Unix tools (`zcat`, `grep`, `tar`) when local disk space is constrained.

## Features

* **Concurrent Downloading**: Uses HTTP Range requests to fetch parts simultaneously.
* **Stream Reordering**: Converts out-of-order chunks into a sequential stream via an internal priority queue.
* **Rate Limiting & Backoff**: AIMD-based rate limiter to handle `429 Too Many Requests` and exponential backoff for network drops.
* **Resumption**: Saves partial state for disk-mode downloads to resume after interruptions.
* **POSIX Compliance**: In stream mode or `--quiet` mode, logs are routed to `stderr` and data to `stdout`.

## Installation

Requires Python 3.11+.

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/Zhukovetski/HydraStream.git
```
or
```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/Zhukovetski/HydraStream.git
```

## Usage

### 1. Download to Disk
Download a file using 20 connections:
```bash
hs "https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/.../genome.fna.gz" -t 20 --output ./data
```

### 2. Stream to stdout (Pipe)
Download concurrently and pipe directly into a decompressor:
```bash
hs "https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/.../genome.fna.gz" -t 20 --stream -q | zcat | wc -l
```

### 3. Python API
```python
import asyncio
from hydrastream.facade import HydraClient

async def main():
    urls =["https://example.com/file1.gz"]
    async with HydraClient(threads=10, quiet=True) as client:
        async for filename, stream in client.stream(urls):
            async for chunk in stream:
                pass # Process chunk bytes

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## CLI Options

| Option | Shortcut | Default | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| `URLS` | - | Required | One or multiple URLs to download. |
| `--threads` | `-t` | `1` | Number of concurrent connections. |
| `--output` | `-o` | `download/` | Output directory. |
| `--stream` | `-s` | `False` | Enable streaming mode (redirects data to `stdout`). |
| `--no-ui` | `-nu` | `False` | Disables progress bars, leaves plain text logs. |
| `--quiet` | `-q` | `False` | Silence console output. Logs are still written to file. |
| `--md5` | | `None` | Expected MD5 hash (single URL only). |
| `--buffer` | `-b` | `threads * 5MB` | Maximum stream buffer size in bytes. |

## Roadmap

* **v1.1: Autonomous Worker Scaling:** Transition from a static thread pool to adaptive concurrency based on network conditions and downstream backpressure.
* **v2.0: Rust Core:** Port the core engine to Rust (`tokio`/`reqwest`) with a `PyO3` wrapper to bypass the Python GIL and improve multi-core execution.
